import React from 'react';
// React is a LIBRARY for building user interfaces. 
/*
There is typically one component for discrete feature of the site, and each of the components follow the same general structure. 
This means that the same code patterns will be enforced throughout the application, which will make the site more maintainable and readable as it is updated. 

Under-the-hood, REACT does a lot of clever calculations to make sure that updates in the broser are calculated as efficiently as possible, thus improving PERFORMANCE. 

---------JOB PROSPECTS--------------------------
REACT is one of the FRAMEWORKS currently in highest demand in the web development industry. React developer salaries often range from $90-$110k per year. (min $7500 a month)
------------------------------------------------

React is still new enough that it's hard for employers to find candidates who understand this powerful FRAMEWORK.

Learning React will give you the skills you need to set yourself apart in the job market!
